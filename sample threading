from multiprocessing import Process
import sys

rocket = 0

def func1():
    global rocket
    print 'start func1'
    while rocket < sys.maxint:
        rocket += 1
    print 'end func1'

def func2():
    global rocket
    print 'start func2'
    while rocket < sys.maxint:
        rocket += 1
    print 'end func2'

if __name__=='__main__':
     p1 = Process(target = func1)
     p1.start()
     p2 = Process(target = func2)
     p2.start()
You will see it print 'start func1' and then 'start func2' and then after a (very) long time you will finally see the functions end. But they will indeed execute simultaneously.

Because processes take a while to start up, you may even see 'start func2' before 'start func1'.
